# Facial emotion recognition using deep learning

The aim of this project is to recognize seven basic emotional states (anger, disgust, fear, happiness, neutral, sadness, surprise) based on images of human facial expressions. The classification is performed using a convolutional neural network (CNN) on the FER-2013 dataset. We then implement our model in a graphical user interface (GUI) application that will access the webcam to recognize the userâ€™s facial expression on the live feed before mapping it with a corresponding emoji that will finally be displayed on screen in real-time.
