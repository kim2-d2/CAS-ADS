## Final Project

**Facial Emotion Recognition using Deep learning**

This project aims to recognize seven basic emotional states (anger, disgust, fear, happiness, neutral, sadness, 
surprise) based on images of human facial expressions. The classification is performed using a 
convolutional neural network (CNN) on the FER-2013 dataset. We then implement our model in 
a graphical user interface (GUI) application that will access the webcam to recognize the userâ€™s 
facial expression on the live feed before mapping it with a corresponding emoji that will finally 
be displayed on screen in real-time.
