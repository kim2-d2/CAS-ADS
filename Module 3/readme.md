# Module 3: Data analysis and machine learning

In this module, we learn about standard analysis techniques and how to apply state-of-the-art machine learning with Python.

Data Analysis and Machine Learning

Basic introduction on how to perform typical machine learning tasks with Python.

## Learning outcomes

- Regression and Classification: linear models and logistic regression
- Decision trees & random forest models
- Principal component analysis (PCA) and non-linear embeddings (t-SNE and UMAP)
- Clustering with K-means and Gaussian mixtures
- Artificial Neural networks as general fitters, fully connected nets used to classify the fashion-MNIST dataset
- Scikit-learn and clustering maps, Q&A
